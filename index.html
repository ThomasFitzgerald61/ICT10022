        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Cafe Name is a local cafe that serves fresh, delicious food and drinks
          in a warm and welcoming environment. But we're more than just a cafe -
          we're committed to making a positive impact on the world around us by
          reducing our environmental footprint and eliminating food waste.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some of the ways we're working towards a more sustainable
          future:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We source our ingredients from local farmers and suppliers who share
            our commitment to sustainability.
          </li>
          <li>
            We use compostable or recyclable packaging for all of our takeout
            orders.
          </li>
          <li>
            We donate any unsold food to local shelters and charities, so
            nothing goes to waste.
          </li>
          <li>
            We compost all of our food waste and use it to fertilize local
            gardens and farms.
          </li>
        </ul>
